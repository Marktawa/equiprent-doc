Create a Google Sheets spreadsheet with the following:
- Name (Product up for rental)
- Price (Rental price per day or per hour etc)
- Description (Short description of item)
- Merchant (Name of merchant supplying the rental equipment)
- Contact (The contact phone number for supplier)
- Image (image of the item use URL)

Coastal Hire is a good example of what an Equipment Rental company website should be:
- In addition to above each product has a short video demonstrating how the tool is used
- Option to collect from warehouse or have it delivery (with an additional cost)
- Each item has a deposit on top of the rental price to give a total rental price. Deposit is refundable depending on certain factors defined in the terms and conditions (Use ChatGPT to find the specific info)
- Quotation Generator
- Product Information (Specifications, Application, Safety, Operation)
- Cart System
- Booking form with date selection, quantity selection
- Auth

The rest of the equipment hire companies do not publish prices. So I will to contact them individually to uncover the information. I will have to draft a message asking for the info on prices.
